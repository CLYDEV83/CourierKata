FundApps Technical Test.

Approx time spent 130 mins.

Entry point for the library/application is the ParcelOrderService.cs and the "CreateOrder()" method.

Further changes would be to add more unit tests to cover more scenarios instead of just happy path, error handling and logging. I'd also simplify the promo helper as I feel the approach I took with this could be made far simpler and perhaps be moved into 1 call instead of the 2 that it is curently. I'd also split the services and helpers out into seperate projects.
